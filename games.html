	<h2 style = "text-align:center;">GAMES</h2>
	<p>Games are more than a from of entertainement, they are an escape from reality if you will. A place where in some games you can do whatever you want with no fear of repercussions apart from the FBI watchlist but also freedom in a very small sense.<br><br> Some of my all time favourites include:</p>

	<ul>
		<a href = "#batman"> <li>Batman: Arkham City</li>  </a>
		<a href = "#motorstorm"><li>Motorstorm</li></a>
		<a href = "#dmc4"> <li>Devil May Cry 4</li></a>
		<a href = "#dmc5"><li>Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition</li></a>
		<a href = "#ff"><li>Free Fire Mobile</li></a>
	</ul>

		<h4>BATMAN : ARKHAM CITY</h4>
		
		<a href = "https://youtu.be/MlX--IPxTRU?si=CBNTjhrz-Fhe9CdB" target = "_blank"><img src = "/home/victor/Pictures/DownloadPractice/batman-arkham-city.jpg" width = "1000" height = "600"></a>
		<p>The game that was part of the Arkham trilogy but the only one I have been able to play myself. It was a masterpiece. The game made you feel like Batman as yoy wore the mask as a vigilante going all over Gotham City beating the lights out of every foe. It was a good one. </p>
	</div>
		

	<div id = "motorstorm">
		<h4>Motorstorm</h4>
		<a href = "https://youtu.be/wig-XT8Rbiw?si=4NALQex98CHX8ZRd" target="_blank"><img src = "/home/victor/Pictures/DownloadPractice/motorstorm-wallpaper.jpg" width = "1000" height = "600"></a>
		<p>If you want to know what offroad racing feels like, look no further than this guy. Absolute menace it was when I was a jit, racing against some of the most aggressive computer opponents who would abandon number one placement just to smack me, it was great. Amazing, adrenaline rushing...and I completed it two times if I'm not mistaken. The whole thing, ranking system and not. I was a serious gamer.</p>
	</div>
		
	

	<div id = "dmc4">
		<h4>Devil May Cry 4</h4>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/3ZJ_cqc7cSM?si=PwNmktHDpl-js6NV" target="_blank"><img src = "/home/victor/Pictures/DownloadPractice/devil-may-cry-4-wallpaper-preview.jpg" width = "1000" height = "600"></a>
		<p>From the gaming series that held it's own for a long time yet was not done justice in the series that Netflix launched. DMC4 started off with Nero, the son of Vergil who was the brother of Danter who were both sons of the legendary demon knight Sparda who turned against his own brethren and shut the demons away. I won't go so much into detail, I know the gaming lore offhead.</p>

	<div id = "dmc5">
		<a href="https://youtu.be/GL4tQAN-bCY?si=X2tf9A_FDV9433tM" target="_blank"><h4>Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition</h4></a>
		<img src = "/home/victor/Pictures/DownloadPractice/wallpapersden.com_devil-may-cry-5-4k_3840x2160.jpg" width = "1000" height = "600">
		<p>The original DMC5 was made even more amazing more artistic, more poetic by not only the addition of two letters <em>'Special Edition'</em> but the availability of one of the most goated gaming characters in existence to be as a playable character, and that is Vergil. I shan't say no more, a storm is appoaching.</p>

	<div id = "ff">
		<h4>Free Fire Mobile</h4>
		<img src = "/home/victor/Pictures/DownloadPractice">
		<p>I don't even know why I play this. I hate my teammates with a passion.</p>
