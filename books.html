	<h1 style="text-align: center; background-color: ghostwhite;">BOOKS</h1>
	<p style="color: ghostwhite;">Novels, Light Novels, Mangas, Manhwas, Comics...You name it and I'll most probably read it. 
		I think the time that I was able to know that I could read any genre was with a book titled <em>The Praetorian Conspiracy</em>. It was a slow typa book, not the type you would find me ever reading and I tried it once and it just bored me. But later I took it and read the whole of it, and heck, it was <em>amazing</em>. Went to show that if I stuck to whatever I thought was peak at the time and never broadened my horizons, I would never have actually gone so far.</p>
		<p style="color: ghostwhite;">But I'll be darned if I say that I do not have a genre that I favor above all else, and that is fantasy. A world created that is so different but somehow similar to the one we are in now. It's a very intriguing concept that I feel pushes writers to their absolute limits to think up of fresh thinks. From power scalings, culture, religion, and so much more that I cannot name. <br><br>

		I would perhaps like my name to be up with one of my all time favorites, J.K. Rowling who wrote the Harry Potter Series and Rick Riordan who authored PErcy Jackson franchise and their related mythology based adaptations which were still amazing.</p>
