		<h3 style="text-align: center;">POETRY?</h3>
		<p>Poetry is more than art, it is a way to live. A bit too deep and you will be right to say that <em>it ain't that deep</em>. POetry is a form of speaking to your own soul and understanding it. Heck, I even tend to want to implement a sort of poetry into my own form of writing.</p>

		<p>No clue, but what I could say is that my love for romance poetry began with tiktok. Her name was Cilia, and the opening lines of the poem which I can remember ever so clearly is that "She fell first but he body slammed right after. She fell first but she dreams of her laughter" I think it would be better if yuou just heard it straight from here.</p>
